The solution involves carefully examining the Gradle build logs to identify the specific dependency conflict or version incompatibility.  The logs are usually found within the `.expo` directory of your project after a failed build.  Based on the error message in the logs, one of the following approaches may be necessary:

1. **Update the Android Gradle Plugin:**  Check your `android/build.gradle` file and update the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` version to the latest stable version.  The specific steps for updating vary depending on your Expo SDK version.  Refer to the Expo documentation for the most up-to-date instructions.

2. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:** If the logs indicate a conflict between specific libraries, check your `android/app/build.gradle` file to ensure that dependency versions are compatible.  Manually specifying versions to resolve conflicts can be required.

3. **Clean the Build:** Use the Expo CLI command `expo prebuild` or manually clean the build folder (often found within the `.expo` directory) to remove any cached build artifacts that may be causing the issue.  Then, rebuild the app. 

4. **Check Gradle Configuration:** Review your `build.gradle` files to ensure the project configuration is correct and all dependencies are correctly declared and versioned.  Pay attention to any potential repository declarations and settings.
