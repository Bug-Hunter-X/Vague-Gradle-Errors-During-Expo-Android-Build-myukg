This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves an issue with the Android Gradle plugin version or a mismatch between the plugin and other dependencies. The error message might not be very specific, but it often relates to Gradle build failures, indicating problems during the project's build process.  For example, a vague error like "Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:debugCompileClasspath'" might appear, pointing to dependency resolution problems.  Further investigation into the Gradle build logs is usually necessary to pinpoint the root cause.  The exact error message and the necessary debugging steps depend on the project's specific dependencies and configuration.
