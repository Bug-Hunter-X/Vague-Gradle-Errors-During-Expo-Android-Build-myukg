# Expo Android Build Errors: Gradle Dependency Resolution Issues

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI. The problem manifests as vague Gradle errors during the build process, often hindering the ability to identify the root cause quickly.

## Problem Description

The core issue stems from dependency resolution problems within the Gradle build system.  Incompatibilities between the Android Gradle Plugin version and other project dependencies lead to errors that are not always clearly descriptive. This makes diagnosing and solving the problem more challenging than it should be.

## Reproducing the Issue

The `buildError.js` file contains a simplified representation of a project that might trigger such errors. While it may not reliably produce the exact error message each time due to the complexity of Gradle's dependency management, it highlights the potential problem areas.

## Solution

The `buildSolution.js` file offers solutions.  The key is to carefully examine the Gradle build logs (typically located within the `.expo` directory after a failed build). These logs contain detailed information about the dependencies, their versions, and the conflicts that arise.  Solutions can involve:

* **Updating the Android Gradle Plugin:** Updating to the latest compatible version often resolves dependency conflicts.
* **Resolving Dependency Conflicts:** Manually identifying conflicting dependencies and adjusting versions may be necessary.
* **Cleaning the Project:** Cleaning the build cache sometimes helps in resolving temporary issues.
* **Checking Gradle Configuration:** Ensuring the Gradle configuration files (`build.gradle`) are correctly configured to match the project's requirements.

## Note

The precise steps to fix the issue depend heavily on the specific error message from the Gradle build.  This repository provides a general approach and guidance on troubleshooting rather than a definitive fix for every scenario.
